### To Open

  $ cd battleships_web
```

### Run my tests

### What I Learned
Working in a team is hard, but communication is key to making progress and learning.

With the exception of a simple webpage I made following [this pill tutorial](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/sinatra_1.md), this was my first experience with putting
something on the web. And it was my first ever attempt to make back end functionality interact with web routes and user
input on the front end.
I learned how to use Sinatra and incorporate Ruby logic on the web. I learned how to create a view with HTML and 
embedded Ruby.
